hbs - Handlebars is a templating engine that allows you to generate HTML dynamically by combining templates with data. 
It's commonly used in web applications to simplify rendering dynamic content on the server or client side. 
Handlebars templates are written in a way that separates the HTML structure from the data, making it easier to 
maintain and reuse code.

HBS is basically a template engine which is used to write html templates so that we can feed dynamic data in it, this avoids feeding unecessary html scripts into the js files, keeps the code clean and easy to manage.

Dynamic content refers to web content that changes based on various factors, such as user interactions, preferences, or external data. Unlike static content, which is fixed and the same for all users, dynamic content is generated in real-time and tailored to specific users or situations.

Examples of Dynamic Content
Personalized Greetings:

Example: "Hello, John!" instead of "Hello, Guest!"
Generated based on user login information.
Search Results:

When you search for "laptops" on an e-commerce site, the content (products, images, descriptions) displayed is dynamically fetched based on your query.
Social Media Feeds:

Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram dynamically load posts, comments, and likes based on your friends and interactions.
Weather Updates:

A weather app shows content specific to your location and time.
Real-time Data:

Stock market prices, sports scores, or news updates are dynamically fetched and displayed in real-time.
E-commerce Recommendations:

Based on browsing history or cart items, a website may recommend products.
How is Dynamic Content Generated?
Dynamic content is typically generated using server-side scripting, client-side scripting, or a combination of both:

Server-side Scripting:

Content is generated on the server before being sent to the user's browser.
Examples: PHP, Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Ruby on Rails.
Use Case: A blog page where articles are fetched from a database.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
app.get('/greet', (req, res) => {
    const user = req.query.user || 'Guest';
    res.send(`<h1>Hello, ${user}!</h1>`);
});
Client-side Scripting:

Content is generated or updated in the user's browser using JavaScript.
Examples: React, Angular, Vue.js, plain JavaScript with APIs.
Use Case: A live chat application that updates messages in real-time without refreshing the page.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', () => {
    document.getElementById('message').textContent = 'Hello, Dynamic World!';
});
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):

Dynamic content often involves fetching data from an API and rendering it on the webpage.
Example: A weather app fetching the current temperature from a weather API.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
fetch('https://api.weather.com/current?location=NY')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        document.getElementById('weather').textContent = `Temperature: ${data.temp}`;
    });
